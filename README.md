## What?
Terratag is a CLI tool allowing for tags or labels to be applied across an entire set of Terraform files. Terratag will apply tags or labels to any AWS, GCP and Azure resources.

### Terratag in action

## Why?
Maintaining tags across your application is hard, especially when done manually. Terratag enables you to easily add tags to your existing IaC and benefit from some cross-resource tag applications you wish you had thought of when you had just started writing your Terraform, saving you tons of time and making future updates easy. [Read more](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-tagging-best-practices.pdf) on why tagging is important.

## How?
### Prerequisites
- Terraform 0.11 through 1.0

### Usage
1. Install from homebrew:
    ```
    brew install env0/terratag/terratag
    ```
    Or download the latest [release binary](https://github.com/env0/terratag/releases) .

1. Initialize Terraform modules to get provider schema and pull child modules:
   ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
1. Run Terratag
      ```bash
       terratag -dir=foo/bar -tags={\"environment_id\": \"prod\"}
   ```

   Terratag supports the following arguments:
   - `-dir` - optional, the directory to recursively search for any `.tf` file and try to terratag it.
   - `-tags` - tags, as valid JSON (NOT HCL)
   - `-skipTerratagFiles` - optional. Default to `true`. Skips any previously tagged - (files with `terratag.tf` suffix)
   - `-filter` - optional. Only apply tags to the selected resource types (regex)

### Example Output
#### Before Terratag
```
|- aws.tf
|- gcp.tf
```

```hcl
# aws.tf
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags {
    Name        = "My bucket"
  }
}
```
```hcl
#gcp.tf
resource "google_storage_bucket" "static-site" {
  name          = "image-store.com"
  location      = "EU"
  force_destroy = true

  bucket_policy_only = true

  website {
    main_page_suffix = "index.html"
    not_found_page   = "404.html"
  }
  cors {
    origin          = ["http://image-store.com"]
    method          = ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"]
    response_header = ["*"]
    max_age_seconds = 3600
  }
  labels = {
    "foo" = "bar"
  }
}

```

#### After Terratag
Running `terratag -tags={\"env0_environment_id\":\"dev\",\"env0_project_id\":\"clientA\"}` will output:

```
|- aws.terratag.tf
|- gcp.terratag.tf
|- aws.tf.bak
|- gcp.tf.bak
```

```hcl
# aws.terratag.tf
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = merge( map("Name", "My bucket" ), local.terratag_added_main)
}
locals {
  terratag_added_main = {"env0_environment_id"="dev","env0_project_id"="clientA"}
}
```
```hcl
# gcp.terratag.tf
resource "google_storage_bucket" "static-site" {
  name          = "image-store.com"
  location      = "EU"
  force_destroy = true

  bucket_policy_only = true

  website {
    main_page_suffix = "index.html"
    not_found_page   = "404.html"
  }
  cors {
    origin          = ["http://image-store.com"]
    method          = ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"]
    response_header = ["*"]
    max_age_seconds = 3600
  }
  labels = merge( map("foo" , "bar"), local.terratag_added_main)
}
locals {
  terratag_added_main = {"env0_environment_id"="dev","env0_project_id"="clientA"}
}
```

### Optional CLI flags

* `-dir=<path>` - defaults to `.`. Sets the terraform folder to tag `.tf` files in
* `-skipTerratagFiles=false` - Dont skip processing `*.terratag.tf` files (when running terratag a second time for the same directory)
* `-verbose=true` - Turn on verbose logging
* `-rename=false` - Instead of replacing files named `<basename>.tf` with `<basename>.terratag.tf`, keep the original filename
* `-filter=<regular expression>` - defaults to `.*`. Only apply tags to the resource types matched by the regular expression

##### See more samples [here](https://github.com/env0/terratag/tree/master/test/fixture)

## Notes
- Resources already having the exact same tag as the one being appended will be overridden

## Develop
Issues and Pull Requests are very welcome!

### Prerequisites
- Go > 1.18

### Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/env0/terratag
cd terratag
go mod tidy
go build
```

### Test

#### Structure
The test suite will look for fixtures under `test/fixtures/terraform_xx`.
Each fixture placed there should have the following directory structure:
```
my_fixture
|+ input
  ...            // any depth under /input
     |- main.tf  // this is where we will run all terraform/terratag commands
|- expected
```

- `input` is where you should place the terraform files of your fixture.
All commands will be executed wherever down the hierarchy where `main.tf` is located.
We do that to allow cases where complex nested submodule resolution may take place, and one would like to test how a directory higher up the hierarchy gets resolved.
- `expected` is a directory in which all `.terratag.tf` files will be matched with the output directory

#### What's being tested?
Each test will run:
- `terraform init`
- `terratag`
- `terraform validate`

And finally, will compare the results in `out` with the `expected` directory

#### Running Tests
Tests can only run on a specific Terraform version -
```
go test -run TestTerraformXX
```

We use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) to switch between versions. The exact versions used in the CI tests can be found under `test/tfenvconf`.

## Release
1. Create and push a tag locally, in semver format - `git tag v0.1.32 && git push origin --tags`
2. Goto [Github Releases](https://github.com/env0/terratag/releases) and edit the draft created by Release Drafter Bot - it should contain the change log for the release (if not press on Auto-generate release notes). Make sure it's pointing at the tag you created in the previous step and publish the release.
3. Binaries will be automatically generated by the Github action defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
4. NPM will automatically pick up on the new version.
